# Rainfall Forecasting

## Overview

Rainfall Forecasting is a data analysis and machine learning project that focuses on predicting rainfall patterns using historical rainfall data. The project involves data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation to provide accurate rainfall predictions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `main.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data analysis, preprocessing, and model selection.
- `.env`: An environment file that stores configuration variables for data file paths and features.
- `README.md` (this file): The project documentation.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you need the following libraries and tools:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

## Project Flow

The project follows the following steps:

1. Data Import and Preprocessing
2. Model Building
3. Model Evaluation
4. Best Model Selection
